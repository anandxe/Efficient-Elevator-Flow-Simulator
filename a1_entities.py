"""CSC148 Assignment 1 - People and Elevators

=== CSC148 Fall 2023 ===
Department of Computer Science,
University of Toronto

=== Module description ===
This module contains classes for the two basic entities in this simulation:
people and elevators. We have provided outlines of these two classes
for you; you are responsible for implementing these two classes so that they
work with the rest of the simulation.

You may NOT change any existing attributes, or the interface for any public
methods we have provided. However, you can add new PRIVATE attributes,
and of course you'll have to implement the methods we've provided, as well
as add your own methods to complete this assignment.

Person and Elevator each inherit from a "sprite" class found in visualizer.py.
This is to enable their instances to be visualized properly.
You may not change visualizer.py, but are responsible for reading the documentation
to understand these classes, as well as the abstract methods your classes must
implement.
